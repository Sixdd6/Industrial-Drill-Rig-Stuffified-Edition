  <targetVersion>0.17.1557</targetVersion>
  <description>Includes a new drilling rig that allows you to mine up small amounts of metals, not intended as a primary source of metal but a good option for playing on flat maps after you've exhausted all of your mineral supplies.\n\n Requires a lot of power and doesn't get much each time but it's better than nothing.\n\n This version includes support for Stuffified Construction.\n\n  Mod Version: 0.17.1.7</description>
